# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
## Project Mentorship
I'm offically calling this "Project Menotship", and you'll see why. The purpose of this project is to not only determine the amount of retiring employees but also to indentify which emmployees are eligable for the mentorship program, "Project Mentorship". The retiring employees by titl information shows all of the employees that were born between January, 1 1952 and December, 31 1955. A query was created to collect the columns emp_no, first_name, and last_name from the employees table. We aslo retrieved the title, from_date and to_date columns from the titles table in the Pewlett_Hackard query. Both of these tables were joined and filtered and stored into a new table. Select data was gathered by using DISTINCT ON function and ORDER BY COUNT function was used to show the total number of titles. Just like that, the data is present, cleaned, and organized!

## Results
- Due to promotions some employees have had multiple positions through their careers. The retirement_titles shows the retiring employees and their advancments shown below
- The unique_tiles talbe shows us the most recent title fof employees at retirement age.
- Majority of employees who are at retirement age have a "senior" title, which is shown in the retirement_titles table.
- Finally, the reason we are all here, mentorship eligibilty, "Project Mentorship". This final part of the prject shows that most of the employees have senior titles!

## Wrap it up!
From the data gathered we can see that 63% of employees are eligable for retirement or eligible for mentorship. Over the next 5-10 years there will be plenty of positons to fill. There may not be enough employees to carry on the tasks for the company or have enough experience to fill the roles. I suggest learning from the retiring group, what made them succesful, waht made them have such long last careers and apply that to the future employees of the company.
